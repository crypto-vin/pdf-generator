## Project Description <a name="description"></a>
This web application is a Flask-based invoice/receipt PDF generator that follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern. It simplifies the process of generating invoices and receipts by automating the creation and formatting of PDF documents. The application is designed to handle a large number of invoices and receipts efficiently.
## Features <a name="features"></a>
- Generate professional-looking invoices/receipts in PDF format.

- Customize the invoice/receipt template with your branding and specific details.

- Store generated invoices/receipts in a secure and organized manner.

- Follows the MVC design pattern for organized and modular code structure.

## Technologies Used <a name="technologies"></a>
- Python: The primary programming language for the backend logic and PDF generation.
- HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap: Used for designing and styling the user interface.
- JavaScript: Used for interactive elements and client-side functionality.
- Flask: A lightweight Python web framework for developing the application.
- MySQL: The chosen database management system for storing and retrieving data.
- ReportLab: A PDF generation library used for creating PDF documents.
## Installation Guide <a name="install"></a>
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Change to the project directory: `cd pdf-generator`
3. Install project dependencies using pipenv: `pipenv install PyMySQL flask`
4. Activate the project's virtual environment: `pipenv shell`
5. Create a file named `.env` in the project's root directory.
6. Inside the `.env` file, set the following environment variables:

```
USER=
PASSWORD=
```
Adjust the values according to your MySQL database configuration.

7. Install ReportLab and python-dotenv libraries: `pip install reportlab python-dotenv`

8. Create a directory named `Invoice` at the root level of the project where the generated files will be stored. `C:\Users\User\Downloads\Invoices`

## Usage Guide <a name="usage"></a>
1. Start the Flask development server: `python server.py`
2. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`
3. Provide the necessary details for generating an invoice/receipt, such as customer information, itemized list, and payment details.
4. Customize the template as needed by selecting different styles, layouts, or adding your logo.
5. Click on the <button style="color:red;">Generate PDF</button> button to generate the invoice/receipt in PDF format.
6. The generated PDF file will be saved in the "Invoice" üìÅ directory. `C:\Users\User\Downloads\Invoices`

## Database Interaction <a name="database"></a>
To retrieve data from the MySQL database, the application utilizes two different approaches:
1. Class Method with SQL Query:

```python
@classmethod
def get_all(cls):
    query = "SELECT * FROM employees.employees;"
    results = connectToMySQL('employees').query_db(query)
    employees = []
    for e in results:
        employees.append(e)
    return employees
```

2. Stored Procedure Approach:

```python
@classmethod
def get_all(cls):
    instance = connectToMySQL('employees')
    connection = instance.connection

    try:
        cursorObject = connection.cursor()
        cursorObject.execute("call employees.get_all()")
        employees = []
        for result in cursorObject.fetchall():
            employees.append(result)
        return employees
    finally:
        connection.close()
```

MySQL Srored Procedure:

```mysql
CREATE DEFINER=`root`@`localhost` PROCEDURE `get_all`()
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM employees.employees;
END
```
Choose the appropriate approach based on your database setup and preference. Update the code as needed to match your specific requirements.
